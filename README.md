Abstract:
This regression project aims to explore and model the relationship between various physicochemical properties of wines and their quality ratings. The dataset utilized for this study is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically the "Wine Quality" dataset. The dataset comprises red and white wine samples, each characterized by input features such as acidity, alcohol content, and residual sugar. The target variable is the quality rating of the wines.

The primary objective of this project is to develop accurate regression models that can predict wine quality based on the provided features. Multiple regression algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods are employed and compared to determine the most effective model. The findings from this study can have practical applications in the wine industry, contributing to the continuous improvement of wine production processes and the overall enhancement of product quality.
